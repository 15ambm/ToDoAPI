Welcome to my basic ToDoAPI

To learn more about REST APIs and NodeJS, I created this basic api that allows you to add, delete and update items on a personal todo list.
Use Postman to make GET, POST, DELETE or PUT requests and change the list. 
Because this is a simple learning exercise, there is no connected database and therefore your list will not persist after you stop running the api.

To use the API
* clone into this repo
* enter the repo and use npm install to get all the required packages
* use npm start to run the api
* the API uses port 3000 by default, which can be accessed through your browser or Postman

To access your list of todos use the following endpoint
/api/list

To run the test suite for the API use npm test
